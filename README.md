# This Side of Paradise
An analysis of architects' salary while I'm preparing for interview

***🔨 Under Construction Now 🏗️***

I make this repo public to be accountable, hence it will be a hot mess for one week or so :)
 
## Repo name origin
This Side of Paradise is the novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, a major theme in which is the **disillusionment** one feels as one grows in his college years. This theme properly describe a lots of **architects' feelings** when they find the disillusionment between their salary and once aspiration, me included, two years ago.

- definition of architects here also includes landscape architects, urban designers, and urban planners, etc. 

- I'll revisit some technical interview questions(e.g., EDA) in this analysis as well.
