***üî® Under Construction Now üèóÔ∏è***

I make this repo public to be accountable, hence it will be a hot mess for one week or so :)
 
## Repo name origin
"This Side of Paradise" is a novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, a major theme in which is the **disillusionment** one feels as one grows in his college years. 

This theme properly describes a lots of architects' feelings when they find the disillusionment between their salary and once aspiration, me included, two years ago.

## Aims
1. Find insights and patterns of architects' salary.
2. Revisit statistics knowledge in practice.
3. Illustrate why I'm leaving architecture/ urban planning industry.

## Note
Definition of architects here: includes landscape architects, urban designers, and urban planners, etc. Because (at least in China) these majors are all under the architecture category in universities.

## Data source
1. A shared excel file, architects inputting their salary-related information anonymously.
